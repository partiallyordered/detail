  - links
  - color
    - detect whether output is terminal or file and color accordingly
    - print different colors for different types? or just different colors for keys and values?
      give the user options?

  - nushell's implementation of ls: https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/76292ef10c6eb4c3eaaba7cf1ee39348580bc55f/crates/nu-command/src/filesystem/ls.rs
- print newline after output?
- color file names (what logic does nushell ls use?)

- how to integrate with nushell?
  - how to return native nushell types?
  - perhaps by producing NUON?
  - look at: `ls | to nuon` and `ls | to nuon | from nuon`
    - and `ls | to nuon | save blah` and `blah | from nuon`
  - nushell uses rfc2822, chrono has a .to_rfc2822 method
  - made an experiment in creating a nuon file from current output; notes
    - needed to remove quotes around values
    - I don't *think* I needed to change the date format, and the dates were displayed nicely by nushell
    - needed to have empty columns (e.g. an absence of git statuses) be either null or empty string
    - adding the b (bytes) suffix was sufficient for nushell to correctly interpret the type of the
      file size
    - I couldn't recover the fancy colored file name and fancy file links for the terminal that
      nushell ls produces- but in fact `ls | to nuon | from nuon` discards these also. Would it
      therefore make sense to architect this so it can easily be a nushell plugin, instead of
      serializing to nuon?
  - nushell plugins:
    - https://www.nushell.sh/contributor-book/plugins.html
    - https://github.com/nushell/nushell/tree/main/crates/nu_plugin_example
    - https://www.nushell.sh/book/plugins.html#adding-a-plugin
    - https://github.com/nushell/awesome-nu
    - looks probable that it's possible to deliver a single binary that can act as a nushell plugin
      *and* a "structured ls"
- date formatting options for all dates, and for each date (i.e. --date-format
  --accessed-date-format)
- file size formatting options
  - including metric & binary formatting options?
- config file
  - walk up the path from the working directory, then a config directory ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME?)
- when the user supplies arguments, collect all the git repositories beforehand, rather than
  getting a git repository per-file
  - or perhaps memoize this by writing a "git repository service" which keeps repositories open
    until the program ends or it's destroyed
  - does this help at all? it's possible to have a single file tracked by two repositories, for
    which the git dir (normally .git, but not necessarily) can be at the same path, but probably
    can be in different paths. In any case, repository::discover could plausibly find one or the
    other. What do we do- just ignore one of them? Probably, it's gotta be an unusual use-case and
    users with files in multiple repos would probably expect to see odd results. *Still*, this is
    possible:
    - parent_dir
      - .git
        - child_dir
          - .git
          - file_tracked_by_parent_dir_git_repo_but_not_by_child_dir_git_repo
    what does libgit2 do in this case? It appears to return a single result, presumably it walks up
    the directory hierarchy and stops once it finds a gitdir (.git?) regardless whether that gitdir
    is tracking any given file. So we could at least assume that any files in the same directory
    (but not the same hierarchy) have the same git repo.
- what's the funky ordering nushell ls uses? Is it actually the same as GNU ls?
  - nushell's implementation of ls: https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/76292ef10c6eb4c3eaaba7cf1ee39348580bc55f/crates/nu-command/src/filesystem/ls.rs
- optionally recurse into subdirectories? Or leave that to a different tool?
- pare down dependencies
  - make some optional, so users can build with only the features they require
- replace git2 with gitoxide?
- what can usefully be exported as a library?

Options
--git-last-changed
  File last changed date according to git (replace file-metadata modified datetime?)
--git
  Short git info, single-character e.g. "i", "m" representing "ignored", "modified", etc.
--git-long
  Long git info, words like "ignored", "modified", etc.
--git-full
  Per-file information e.g. number of lines added/removed, probably represented as a record.
  Though perhaps the only additional information that's interested is indeed lines added/removed,
  rather than status, in which case --git-status and --git-changed or similar might be more
  appropriate.
--jsonl
  Print jsonl instead of a json array- some tools handle jsonl and it's probably easier to parse one object per
  line than to parse a huge array
--print-full-path
--follow-symlinks?
